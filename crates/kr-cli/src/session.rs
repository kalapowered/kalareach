//! Attaching a terminal and driving it until the attachment ends.
//!
//! An attach is three things happening at once: bytes from the terminal going to the session, bytes
//! from the session going to the terminal, and a connection that can end at any moment. They run in
//! one loop rather than in tasks that each decide separately when to stop, because every way this
//! ends has to end the *other two* as well. A terminal left in raw mode because one half was still
//! waiting for a keystroke is the failure section 8 names.
